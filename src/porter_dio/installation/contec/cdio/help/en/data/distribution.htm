<h1>About application distribution (Build the execution environment)</h1>
<p>
The following files are required for executing the application in which the API-DIO(LNX) are used.<br>
<p>
<pre>
config/contec_dio.conf .......... Setting file
config/180-cdiousb.rules ........ Rules file
config/contec_dio_start.sh ...... Driver start script
config/contec_dio_stop.sh ....... Driver stops script
config/cdio.o ................... Device driver
config/cdiousb.o ................ Device driver
/usr/lib/libcdio.so ............. Shared library
/usr/lib/libcdio.so.1.0 ......... Shared library
</pre>
<p>
Setting file, device driver, driver start script are put in same path.<br>
Please put the setting file and device driver in the same path as the 
start script. If you edit the driver start script and specify the device driver in full path, the device driver
and setting file can be put in another location.<br>
<p>
You must copy the setting file to /proc after the driver is started by insmod command.<br>
<p>
You can copy libcdio.so.1.0 to /usr/lib, make the symbolic link to /usr/lib/libcdio.so, the shared library
can be used when ldconfig command is executed.<br>
For details, refer to cdio/library/makefile.<br>
<p>
Linux driver includes the kernel version, device driver files are put in each kernel version folder
because version is checked when the insmod command is performed. <br>
There is no problem if the kernel version of development environment is same as the executing environment,
but if the kernel version of development environment is different from the executing environment, please note it.<br>
You need use the driver module fitted to the executing environment.<br>
<p>
If you want to start driver when the system start, please set to start the device driver in /etc/rc.d/rc.local.<br>
