<h1>Error list</h1>
<p>
Errors acquired by the status acquisition function (DioDmGetStatus) are explained here.<br>
Errors are expressed as the logical sum of the values shown below.<br>

</tr><td>DIODM_STATUS_FIFOEMPTY</td><td>00000001h</td><td>Output only</td><td>Error</td><td>Indicates that FIFO becomes vacant.<br>
																						The main cause is that the system load is high and bus master transfers cannot be completed in time.<br>
																						Countermeasures such as reducing the transfer rate or reducing the system load are required.</td></tr>
</tr><td>DIODM_STATUS_FIFOFULL</td><td>00000002h</td><td>Input only</td><td>Error</td><td>Indicates that FIFO is full due to input.<br>
																						The main cause is that the system load is high and bus master transfers cannot be completed in time.<br>
																						Reduce the transfer rate and system load.</td></tr>
</tr><td>DIODM_STATUS_SGOVERIN</td><td>00000004h</td><td>Input only</td><td>Error</td><td>Indicates that the buffer has overflowed.<br>
																						The amount of data trying to be transferred exceeds the buffer size.<br>
																						Increase the buffer size.</td></tr>
</tr><td>DIODM_STATUS_TRGERR</td><td>00000008h</td><td>Input/output</td><td>Error</td><td>Indicates that start and stop signals have been inserted simultaneously by external start.<br>
																						If this status is generated, transfer is not executed.<br>
																						Check the insertion style of the external start signal and external stop signal.</td></tr>
</tr><td>DIODM_STATUS_CLKERR</td><td>00000010h</td><td>Input/output</td><td>Error</td><td>Indicates that the next clock is inserted during data input/output by the external clock.<br>
																						It is almost impossible for this status to be generated by the board operation speed.<br>
																						If it occurs, consider reducing the external clock.</td></tr>
