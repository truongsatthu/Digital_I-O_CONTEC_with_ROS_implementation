<h1>Synchronization control connector (SC connector)</h1>
<p>
Synchronization control connectors (SC connector) provide a simple method of synchronizing
 board operations by sharing the start, clock, and stop signals of a number of boards
  (same type, different type).<br>
It is used when the number of board channels need to be increased or if digital I/O and 
analog I/O need to be executed simultaneously.<br>
<br>
Synchronization signal lines from EXTSIG1 to EXTSIG3 are prepared for the synchronization control connector. 
The board where those signals are output is called the master, and receiving side boards are called slaves. 
Only one unit should be set as a master within a synchronized board group, with all others set as slaves.<br>
<br>
Slaves can be operated by synchronizing signals from the master by allocating synchronization signal lines 
from EXTSIG1 to EXTSIG3 to the start, clock, and stop conditions.<br>
<br>
What kind of signal is allocated to synchronization signal lines should be set at the master side.
 For example, the external start and internal clock of the board are available for this signal.
Refer to the DioDmSetSetMasterCfg function specification for details of the signal types that
 can be output on the synchronization signal lines.
<br>
<br>
Whether or not input of the synchronization signal lines is to be valid, and 
which synchronization signal lines from EXTSIG1 to EXTSIG3 are to be used 
for the sampling conditions of start, clock, and stop, are set at the slave side.
Signals other than synchronization signal lines can be used for the sampling conditions of the slaves.
For example, only the synchronization control connector signal is used for start and stop signals, 
and an internal clock that differs from the master can be used for the clock.<br>
<br>
Synchronization control connectors are CN2 and CN3 connectors on the board.
Use a connector attached on the board to connect the lines.<br>
