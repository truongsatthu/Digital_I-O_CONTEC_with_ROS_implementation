<h1>Interrupt</h1>
<p>
When you use our digital input and output boards, interrupt is a function that can notify UP or DOWN of input bits by interrupt.<br>
<p>
The position and number of available input bits are different according to device.<br>
For details, please see the hardware specification of each device. And, for the current device, interrupt logic can be UP or DOWN.<br>
<p>
DIO_INT_RISE and DIO_INT_FALL are parameters of software, DIO_INT_RISE expresses that the input value change from 0 to 1, DIO_INT_FALL expresses that the input value change from 1 to 0. Please pay attention, as voltage level, UP and DOWN is different based on the board of positive logic or negative logic.<br>
<p>
The interrupt in API-DIO(LNX) is implemented depending on the OS functionality. The interrupt action only gives the notification to application.<br>
Because the response speed is different according to CPU, kernel version and so on, please understand that the high-speed response in several us is probably not achievable.<br>
<p>
If you want to implement a high-speed process by interrupt, please describe optional process you want into the open function in the driver.<br>
