<h1>Trigger Function</h1>
<p>
Trigger function is a function that uses the OS timer to monitor the change of the input bit of digital input and output board. When the value changes, the application is notified.<br>
<p>
The cycle and accuracy of monitoring trigger are controlled by OS function.<br>
