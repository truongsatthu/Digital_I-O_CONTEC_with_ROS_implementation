This package is for implementing of a digital I/O board which is an interface board that adds the ability to input and output digital signals in parallel to a computer. Using a digital I/O device makes it possible to monitor (read) the statuses of measuring devices as well as the relays and operation switches of various types of control circuits. In addition to controlling output for lamps, LEDs, 7-segment displays, and relays, such products can also be used as an interface for digital communication with controllers such as a PLC (sequencer).

It is an completed pakage to interface with ROS and fully configurable.
